# GameDash - Play a Random Game!

Ever been so bored you couldn't figure out what to do? Well, say goodbye to boredom and hello to random fun with GameDash! ðŸŽ®

This extension lets you play a random browser-based game from a curated collection of indie titles when you need something to pass the time. Just hit the button, and boom - youâ€™re transported to a game you probably didnâ€™t know existed but will love.

### Features:
 - **Random Game Fun:** Every time you hit the button, GameDash sends you to a random browser game. Perfect for when youâ€™re bored and indecisive!
 - **Game History:** Keep track of your adventures with a handy list of the last 15 games youâ€™ve played. Want to revisit a game? No problem - click the link in the list and jump back into action.
 - **No Repeats:** Donâ€™t worry about seeing the same game twice! As long as a game is in your list of recent games, it wonâ€™t come up again until itâ€™s rotated out.
 - **Curated Game List:** All games are handpicked from a collection of browser-based titles sourced from itch.io. The list is hosted on GitHub, allowing for easy and frequent updates, so you'll always have new games to explore!
